    "Crimes in Boston is a dataset containing the data of the crimes occurred in Boston from the middle of 2015 to the middle of 2019. The data does not only include felony cases by also minor incidents like property lost. The total amount of incident is 282 517 and 17 different variables is usually connected with each incident. The type of crime, date and time, location and if shooting occurred are some of the variables captured in the data.\n",

    "----- \n",
    "The data used in this work is collected by the Crime Incident Report system provided by Boston Police Department. There is therefore high confidence in the data contained, and it is not imputed any new values to the dataset in the means of handling NAN-values in the set. For the goal of this assignment, which was to inspect the dataset with a general approach, there was no need to calculate and handle missing data by using imputing-strategies of mean/meadian etc. The approach when dealing with missing data here, has been to discard the columns with missing values for the relevant graph or plot.\n",
    "One could argue that this leads to loss of valuable data, but the inspection and plotting done here is for getting an overview using alot of datapoints compared to the entities with missing values. For the same reason, the very few outlier-alike values in the datapoints where included in the plots. The conclusions and results made in this assignment should still be read with this in mind, and adjustments may be nescessary for specific tasks in future work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inspection and visualization done in this project can be seen as a good place to start for further work on the Bostin Crime Dncident Data. The dataset mostly containes time and place-descriptive information. Therefore it was natural to start visualizing developement of incidents over a period of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The knowlegde obtained from datainspection is a valuable asset when providing services such as public help or when handling a finite amount of resources (tax income). Knowing what a thypical day, week, month or year looks like can be benefitial when trying to pinpoint how to prioritize resources and workforce to reduce bad outcomes from police responses. Further work on this assignment could include trying to make good predictions of what kind of incidences will happen at a given time, and where. When using different methods for machine learning, one should also consider how to handle categorical data in dataset for optimizig the results, \n",
